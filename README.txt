We worked on every part together, so we didn't assign a certain part to a certain person. We shared the same computer too as Java was only installed on Gianfranco's, so the coding and brainstorming for each part was done in unison. Eric made the git repo as he had more experience with the platform. Gianfranco did more of the typing as it was his computer. However, we equally contributed to the development of the code. 

We mostly implemented minimax using a weighted heuristic that took into account the best and worst board states we were in by weighing certain occupied board positions differently. For example, corner pieces were worth much more if we ended up with them; however, if the opponent ended up with them  it would take away points. We experimented mostly with the weights of these heuristics until we could consistently beat the bots. Our only viable idea that got us consistent victories was a weighted heuristic minimap.
